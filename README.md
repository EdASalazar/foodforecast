## About Foode Forecast

I left my class one night trying to think about what I would want to spend time on. Finding a project that you have a passion for can make the hard work a little easier. A few minutes later I was buying tacos down the street from Tacos La Geura. 

So I decided to do build something for people like myself. People who stop when they see 20 people huddled around a folding table and a grill on some random street. People who still get child like joy when they see an ice cream truck or hear the elote vendor coming down the street. (If you've never had elote please try it as soon as you can.)

This website is a way for people passionate about non-tradition food venues to share their expereinces and suggestions. As it develops I want it people with a passion for street food togehter.

Users can add food vendors to the database. They can review them. Look at what other people eating. Comment on their posts. 


## Project Planning

The basis of the project was trying to bring together both the vendors and their customers into one place. Where customers can exchange reviews and look at other reviews.

## Future Developments

1. I've reached out to APIs that are tracking food trucks and other vendors. I hope to integrate that information into the website.
2. I want to integrate more search functionality for the vendors.
3. I want to be able to filter and sort reviews.
4. I plan on integrating the Google Maps API. So that users can places markers on a map for their favorite spots. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Log in. Leave a review. Tell everyone about your favorite taco or fruit stand.
